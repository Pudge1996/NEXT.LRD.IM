I shared my excitement about the PTE test result in the previous post. In this post, I would like to share what English-speaking skills I learned from my learning journey, which especially met the PTE test criteria.

## PTE's criteria

Let's take a look at the two key criteria in the PTE's speaking component: Pronunciation and Fluency.

![pronunciation and oral fluency criteria](url)

Based on the criteria, I would like to highlight these key points: 

**Pronunciation:**
1. Vowels and consonants;
2. Word stress;
3. Sentence-level stress;
4. Assimilation and deletions.

**Fluency:**
1. Rhythm and phrasing;
2. No hesitations.

As we can see, the PTE's test criteria clearly show concepts we must fully understand and perfectly present if we want to achieve a higher score. In the following text, I will demonstrate my comprehension and online resources regarding these concepts.

## Pronunciation

### Vowels and consonants

In daily conversation, sightly mispronounced words might not negatively influence our discussion process or gain information. But thanks to modern technology, PTE's scoring is based on algorithms and implemented by computers that can easily detect each mispronunciation. Therefore, concise pronunciation is crucial.

I tried numerous ways to rectify my pronunciation, especially attempting to get rid of my Chinese accent, like speaking loudly, having more emotion or even mimicking "local accents" directly. However, it didn't work as expected, it still sounded awful, resulting in a low score in PTE practice.

Changes occurred once I met Sun's tutorials and BBC Learning English collection on YouTube. These pronunciation videos elaborate on vowel and consonant details, with vivid body language and emotion.

As non-native speakers who want to pronounce concisely, we must focus on these points: 

**Mouth Shape**
We should mimic the mouth shape that vowels and consonants request. For example: 

1. When pronouncing `/æ/` sounds like `Agriculture` and `Activity`, we should open our mouths as large as possible; 
2. When pronouncing `/i:/` sounds like `These` and `Feed`, the corners of our mouths should be as far apart as possible;
3. When pronouncing `/v/` sounds like `Move` and `University`, our upper teeth should bite down on the lower lip.

**Tongue Position**
We should also pay more attention to the tongue position. For example: 

1. The `/th/` sound requires us to extend the tongue forward, but when it is presented as an unstressed word (we will discuss this concept later), our tongues just touch our higher teeth slightly;
2. The `/r/` sound requires us to pull the front part of the tongues back and up and keep the back stable, making our tongues fatter and thicker.

**Breath**
We should also carefully control our breath, ensuring vowels and consonant sounds are presented appropriately. For example:

1. When pronouncing `/th/` like `Through` and `Thesis`, we should ensure that the airflow passes through the gap between our teeth and lips;
2. When pronouncing `/b/` and `/p/` like `Big` and `Picture`, we should ensure that the airflow is completely blocked and then released suddenly.

Focusing on these points helps us ensure our study paths are on the right track, and consistently improve our pronunciation. In addition, there are two tips: 

1. **Don't try to mimic accents.** The PTE test does not expect you to have a sound or natural accent, and to achieve a real British accent or American accent is time-consuming and pointless for beginners.

2. **Never compare pronunciation with English and Chinese.** For instance, `士多啤梨` is always regarded as `Strawberry` in Cantonese, which neglects many details of English pronunciation. Please stop doing this in daily practice, English and Chinese pronunciation are completely different.

### Word stress

Each Chinese character only includes one syllable, however, English words typically consist of two or more syllables. 

For example, the word `water` consists of two syllables: `wa-ter`, and `theoretical` consists of five syllables: `the-o-ret-i-cal`. It depends on how many vowel sounds the word includes.

![pronunciation and oral fluency criteria](url)

Typically, an English word includes stressed syllables and unstressed syllables, we can find it from the phonetic symbol of words.

For example, the phonetic symbol of `agri-cul-ture` is `/ˈæɡrɪ-kʌl-tʃər/`, we can see the stress mark `/'/` is placed in the first syllable `/ˈæɡrɪ/`, which known as a stressed syllable, while others are unstressed syllable.

**What should we do?**
Speak each syllable with different efforts:

1. Stressed syllables should be pronounced longer and louder;
2. Unstressed syllables should be pronounced shorter and thinner, or take place from the Schwa (we will discuss it later.)

When training pronunciation, we can exaggerate these nuances, ensuring our on the right track and fully comprehend this concept. Eventually, it should sound natural and less effort.

Well-presented in the word stress is key to making our speaking more like English, and it can significantly help us cast off the "Chinglish."

### Sentence-level stress

To meet this criteria, there are two concepts we should understand: **Content/Grammar Words** and **Stressed Words**.

In the English world, there are two types of words within a sentence: **Content words** and **Grammar words**. 

1. **Content words** like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs play an important role in sentence structure and convey main information.
2. **Grammar words** like prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and articles are used to link content words to make up a complete sentence, we can't understand a sentence that only includes grammar words.

**What should we do?**
When speaking a sentence, we should present clear and concise content words on one hand, and reduce and weaken the voice of grammar words on the other. Consider the example below:

![I would like to read books, [I, like, read, books] and [would, to]](url)

Words like `I` `like` `read` and `books` are content words, they should sound clear and accurate, while words like `would` and `to` are grammar words, and they should sound lighter than those content words. 

The second point is to decide which words should be stressed. This is an easy-to-understand concept but hard to implement when we are facing a complex sentence. I will demonstrate it through Chinese examples: 

![公园里有【漂亮的】花朵，这些水果【特别】好吃](url)

We stress some special words in our mother tongue subconsciously, furthermore, the stressed word will influence the meaning. 

For instance, we can express "There are beautiful flowers in the park." in these different ways:

1. "**There** are beautiful flowers in the park." We are pointing out the location;
2. "There are **beautiful flowers** in the park." We are emphasizing the flowers, not buildings or trees;
3. "There are beautiful flowers in the **park**." We are emphasizing the place where the beautiful flowers are located.

In conclusion, I suggest that we should follow the general rules to avoid the potential risk of mistakes and mispronunciation because the given text is unexpected when we are sitting the PTE test. Here are two steps:

**1. Understanding the text.**
Instead of speaking without any consideration and comprehension, we should understand what ideas the writer attempting to convey before we open our mouths. Furthermore, we should also analyze the sentence's elements and structure, including subjects, verbs, objects, content words, grammar words, and clauses.

**2. Marking the stressed words and unstressed words.**
Generally, we always stress one word in a phrase, choosing from a range of words like objects, gerunds, passive verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Here are several examples from the real test: 

> Globalisation refers to a **set** of changes rather than a **single** change.

Stress what authors attempt to emphasize. In this case, the author is declaring it is a **set**, not a **single** change.

> You will be **introduced** briefly to the discipline of **child** psychology and to theories and ...

We always stress adjectives and adverbs that modify a noun. If they are connected, stress the first one. Similarly, when facing a compound noun, we stress the first noun generally.

Although choosing the stressed words is subjective, they should be chosen from an appropriate scope that I mentioned before.

### Assimilation and deletions

This is the most exciting part of my learning journey. They make our English speaking vivid, dynamic and more attractive. Let me explain what they are.

Some voices can be transformed or dropped in specific circumstances. Here are a few examples:

1. **Using the Schwa.** Grammar words and articles can be reduced to a "Schwa sound", such as `/to/` becomes `/tə/`, `/of/` becomes `/ef/`;
2. **Combining sounds** Link the same voices that are connected, such as `United States students`, two `/s/` voices become one `/s:/` sound but a bit longer;
3. **Dropping sounds.** To keep fluency in rapid speech, we drop explosive sounds between two consonants, such as `an important role` becomes `an importan role`;
4. **Holding sounds.** Similarly, we hold explosive sounds but do not release them when these sounds between a vowel and a consonant, such as `that person` becomes `tha-person`;
5. **Linking vowels.** When a word ends with explosive sounds like `/t/`, `/k/`, and `/p/` and the following word begins with a vowel sound, we link it together, such as `that element` becomes `tha-telement`.
6. **Inserting new sounds.** When a word ends with a vowel sound and the following word begins with a vowel sound, we insert new sounds, for instance: `many of /ˈmeni əv/` becomes `/ˈmeni jəv/`. 
7. **Reducing /h/ sounds.** When a word ends with explosive sounds and the following word begins with the `/h/` sound, we always reduce the `/h/` sound, such as "might have" becomes "migh-tave" and "an hour" becomes "a-nour."

There are lots of variations that we should learn and practice, some beginners might feel overwhelmed, however, this is a vital part if we want to speak like a native and sound natural. Keep learning from online resources and practice consistently until you feel comfortable.

## Fluency

### Rhythm and phrasing

These two concepts are related to the term "Thought groups." When speaking English, we always separate the sentences into several groups by their meanings, emotions, structures or lengths. Here is an example from the real test: 

1. Many papers you write in college / will require you to include quotes / from one or more sources.
2. The speaker reminisces / about his views of the English Revolution / when he was a student.

In particular, we break sentences down before the preposition like "of", "in" and "that", and we never separate between compound words like "the English Revolution."

Furthermore, I suggest that we separate fragmentarily when practicing this concept, like this: 

Many papers / you write in college / will require you / to include quotes / from one or more sources.

However, the PTE test would like a longer phrase, so I suggest that each group should have 4 to 7. 

Now we know what is the term "Thought groups" and how to divide a sentence, the next step is how to present this concept well, it is related to the term "intonation". Intonation means the words are sounded in a higher pitch or a lower pitch.

Intonation can bring rhythm to speaking, however, it is hard to handle and can cause trouble easily for beginners. 

**What should we do?**
1. Always drop the pitch to the last word of a thought group;
2. Carefully present a higher pitch to the adjectives or adverbs when modifying the noun.

### No hesitations

PTE test can detect any hesitation or mispronunciation which can negatively influence our final score, especially in the Read Aloud and Repeat Sentence module. 

Despite numerous difficulties on the test day, such as we are disrupted by other testers or meeting a word that have never seen, I mainly suggest we speak slowly and confidently.

This is a strategy, when we face a word or phrase that is hard to express and may cause hesitations unavoidably, we may lose scores of both Pronunciation and Fluency, while if we express them slowly and confidently that keep a natural flow, we only lose Pronunciation's score. That is why I strongly maintain that we should speak confidently even when making mistakes.

## Summary

This article mainly shares knowledge that I learned through the English learning journey, including methods of how to rectify our pronunciation and concepts of PTE's criteria of the speaking module. 

Additionally, I decided to write posts in English from now on, this post is my first try. Although it may consist of numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentences and word-choice issues, I must take a step forward. "Practice makes perfect" is what I learned at the end of this journey.
