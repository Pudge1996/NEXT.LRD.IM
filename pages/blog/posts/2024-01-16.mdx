I shared my excitement about the PTE test result in the previous post. But in this post, I would like to demonstrate what English-speaking rules I learned from my learning journey, which especially met the PTE test criteria.

I would like to say that this post is study notes, rather than regarded as an instruction to guide someone.

## PTE's criteria

Let's take a look at the two key criteria in PTE's speaking component: Pronunciation and Fluency.

![pronunciation and oral fluency criteria](url)

Based on the criteria, I would like to highlight several main points: 

**Pronunciation:**
1. Vowels and consonants;
2. Word stress;
3. Sentence-level stress;
4. Assimilation and deletions.

**Fluency:**
1. Rhythm and phrasing;
2. No hesitations or non-native phonological simplifications.

As we can see, the PTE's test criteria clearly show concepts we must fully understand and perfectly present if we want to achieve a higher score. In the following text, I will demonstrate my comprehension and online resources regarding these concepts.

## Pronunciation

### Vowels and consonants

In daily conversation, sightly mispronounced words might not negatively influence our discussion. But thanks to modern technology, PTE's scoring is based on algorithms and implemented by computers that can easily detect each mispronunciation. Therefore, concise pronunciation is crucial.

I tried numerous ways to rectify my pronunciation, especially attempting to get rid of my Chinese accent, like speaking loudly, having more emotion or even mimicking "local accents" directly. However, it didn't work as expected, I still got a lower score in practice. 

Changes occurred once I met Sun's tutorials and BBC Learning English collection on YouTube(Links below). These pronunciation videos elaborate on every vowel and consonant detail, with vivid body language and emotion.

As non-native speakers who want to pronounce concisely, we must focus on these points: 

**Mouth Shape**
We should mimic the mouth shape that vowels and consonants request. For example: 

1. When pronouncing `/æ/` sounds like `Agriculture` and `Activity`, we should open our mouths as wide as possible; 
2. When pronouncing `/i:/` sounds like `These` and `Feed`, the corners of our mouths should be as far apart as possible;
3. When pronouncing `/v/` sounds like `Move` and `University`, our upper teeth should bite down on the lower lip.

**Tongue Position**
We should also pay more attention to the tongue position. For example: 

1. The `/th/` sound requires us to extend the tongue forward, but when it is presented as an unstressed word (we will discuss this concept later), our tongues just touch our higher teeth;
2. The `/r/` sound requires us to pull the front part of the tongues back and up and keep the back stable, making our tongues fatter and thicker.

**Breath**
We should also carefully control our breath, ensuring vowels and consonant sounds are presented appropriately. For example:

1. When pronouncing `/th/` like `Through` and `Thesis`, we should ensure that the airflow passes through the gap between our teeth and lips;
2. When pronouncing `/b/` and `/p/` like `Big` and `Picture`, we should ensure that the airflow is completely blocked and then released suddenly.

Focusing on these points helps us ensure our study paths are on the right track, and consistently improve our pronunciation. Moreover, there are two tips: 

1. **Don't try to mimic accents.** The PTE test does not expect you to have a sound or natural accent, and to achieve a real British accent or American accent is time-consuming and pointless for beginners.

2. **Never compare pronunciation with English and Chinese.** For instance, `士多啤梨` is always regarded as `Strawberry` in Cantonese, which neglects many details of English pronunciation. Please stop doing this in daily practice, English and Chinese pronunciation are completely different.

### Word stress

Each Chinese character only includes one syllable, however, English words typically consist of more than one syllable. 

For example, the word `water` consists of two syllables: `wa-ter`, and `theoretical` consists of five syllables: `the-o-ret-i-cal`. it depends on how many vowels the word includes.

Typically, an English word includes stressed syllables and unstressed syllables, we can find it from the phonetic symbol of words.

For example, the phonetic symbol of `agri-cul-ture` is `/ˈæɡrɪ-kʌl-tʃər/`, we can see the stress mark `/'/` is placed in the first syllable `/ˈæɡrɪ/`, which known as a stressed syllable, while others are unstressed syllable.

**What should we do?**
Speak each syllable with different efforts:

1. Stressed syllables should be pronounced longer and louder;
2. Unstressed syllables should be pronounced shorter and thinner, or take place from the Schwa (we will discuss it later.)

When training pronunciation, we can exaggerate these difficulties, ensuring our on the right track and fully comprehend this concept. Eventually, it should sound natural and less effort.

Well-presented in the word stress is key to making our speaking more like English, and it can significantly help us get rid of the "Chinglish."

### Sentence-level stress

To meet this criteria, there are two concepts we should understand: **Content/Grammar Words** and **Stressed Words**.

In the English world, there are two types of words within a sentence: **Content words** and **Grammar words**. 

1. **Content words** like nouns, verbs, and adjectives play a crucial role in sentence structure and convey main information.
2. **Grammar words** like prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and articles are used to link content words to make up a complete sentence, we can't understand a sentence that only includes grammar words.

**What should we do?**
When speaking a sentence, we should present clear and concise content words on one hand, and reduce and weaken the voice of grammar words on the other. Consider the example below:

![I would like to read books, [I, like, read, books] and [would, to]](url)

Words like `I` `like` `read` and `books` are content words, they should sound clear and accurate, while words like `would` and `to` are grammar words, and they should sound lighter than those content words. 

The second point is to decide which words should be stressed. This is an easy-to-understand concept but hard to implement when we are facing a foreign language. I will demonstrate it by using Chinese examples: 

![公园里有【漂亮的】花朵，这些水果【特别】好吃](url)

We stress some special words in our mother tongue subconsciously, it also should be mentioned that the stressed word will influence the meaning. 

For instance, we can say "There are beautiful flowers in the park." in these ways:

1. "**There** are beautiful flowers in the park." We are pointing out the location;
2. "There are **beautiful flowers** in the park." We are emphasizing the flowers, not buildings or trees;
3. "There are beautiful flowers in the **park**." We are emphasizing the place where the beautiful flowers are located.

In conclusion, choosing the stressed word appropriately is crucial. When we are sitting the PTE test, the given text is unexpected, I suggest that we should follow the general rules to avoid the potential risk of mistakes and mispronunciation. Here are two steps:

**1. Understanding the text.**
Instead of speaking without any consideration and comprehension, we should understand what ideas the writer attempting to convey. Furthermore, we should also analyze the sentence's elements and structure, including subjects, verbs, objects, content words, grammar words, and clauses.

**2. Marking the stressed words and unstressed words.**
Generally, we always stress one word in a phrase, choosing from objects, gerunds, passive verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Here are several examples from the real test: 

> Globalisation refers to a **set** of changes rather than a **single** change.

Stress what authors attempt to emphasize. In this case, the author is declaring it is a **set**, not a **single** change.

> You will be **introduced** briefly to the discipline of **child** psychology and to theories and ...

We always stress adjectives and adverbs that modify a noun. If they are connected, stress the first one. Similarly, when facing a compound noun, we stress the first noun generally.

Although choosing the stressed words is subjective, they should be chosen from an appropriate scope that I mentioned before.

### Assimilation and deletions

This is the most exciting part of my learning journey. They make our English speaking vivid, dynamic and more interesting. Let me explain what they are.

#### Assimilation

#### Deletions

Some voices can be dropped in the specific circumstances. Here are a few examples:

1. **Using the Schwa.** Grammar words and articles can be reduced to a "schwa", such as `/to/` becomes `/tə/`, `/of/` becomes `/ef/`;
2. **Using Linkings.** Dropping the same voices that are connected, like `United States students`, two `/s/` sounds become one `/s:/` sound but a bit longer.

Practice consistently and feel comfortable with these phenomenons, they are important to get a high score on the PTE test and sound more natural.
